I finished LinkedList and ArrayList. There are five java file in this zip file.
The URArrayList and URLinkedList are the two main classes. I write three java program
to test Lists. The URArrayListTest is for URArrayList and URLinkedListTest is create
specifically for URLinkedList. In order to test the files, TA's should open the file and
run it. The result will come up automatically. Furthermore, I create a special test file
which can test both URArrayList and URLinedList, which is called Test. In this file TA should
open it and run it. But this one is a little different from previous, if there are any mistakes
the program will print something out. If there is nothing printed out, that means the program don't have
any errors.

In the zip file, it contains 1 function code(Expr.java) 1 GUI code(URCalcualtorGUI.java) 1 main function(URCalcluator) and 3 classes(MyList, MyStack and MyQueue) 2 input txt file (one with space and other don't) 2 output txt file(for each input file) 

How to work:
first go into the terminal 
Enter cd /Users/zzh/IntelliJ\ Programs/CSC_172_Project/Project\ 1\ -\ Renew (location)
Type javac URCalculator.java
Type java URCalculator infix_expr_short.txt my_eval.txt (the case has space)
Finally the solution will be appear and there is a new txt file called my_eval.txt will be generated. 


Extra Creidt:
Sin Cos Tan 
invalid expression 
GUI
none space case


OUTPUT:

The first time we tested it with spaces, we entered the infix_expr_short.txt document and expected to get a file called my_eval.txt with the answers from infix_expr_short.txt. We need to compare it to postfix_eval_short.txt. If they all match, the program is correct.

The second time we tested without spaces, we entered the infix_expr_short_nospace.txt document and expected a file called my_eva_nospacel.txt with the answers from infix_expr_short.txt. We need to compare it to postfix_eval_short.txt. If they all match, the program is correct.

Last output is sin cos tan. we calculator sin10, cos10 tan10. This is calculated in radians.


Extra GUI:

Open the URCalculatorGUI.java and run it. Enter what you want to calculate. Finallyï¼Œclick the calculate button.

In this Project, I have two Java files. The first is HuffmanSubmit.java, and the second is HuffmanCoding.java.
I write the primary function in HuffmanCoding and use the function to implement two methods in HuffmanSubmit:
encode and decode.

Also, there are two tested files: an image (ur.jpg) and a text story (alice30.txt). When you run the code, it
will create a freq.txt file containing the frequency and a decoded file. Finally, compare the two Java codes;
if the input and output files are the same, the code is correct!
